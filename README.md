# Custom-Gaming-Controller

## About The Project

I'm currently working on designing a gaming controller inspired by the PlayStation layout. The phases of the project include constructing the schematic, designing the PCB layout, programming, and soldering the components to the board. The project aims to deliver a gaming experience that rivals other gaming controllers in terms of functionality while providing an opportunity to delve into the intricacies of gaming controller design.

### Design Features:
*  4 layer PCB (SIGNAL/GND/GND/SIGNAL)
*  ATmega32u4 microcontroller
*  11 buttons, 2 joysticks
*  USB-C connectivity to computer for power
*  ISP pins for programming input handling
